    title: "A Father’s Burden",
    price: 7.00,
    excerpt: "The weight of nine rests heavy, yet love keeps me strong...",
    text: `The weight of nine rests heavy on my chest,
but love refuses to let me fall.
Every cry, every laugh, every little request
becomes another stone in the wall.

Yet these stones are not prisons,
they are monuments of devotion.
Though the nights are long and the hours stolen,
I carry my children like an ocean.`

  {
    id: "p2",
    title: "Whispers of Tomorrow",
    price: 5.00,
    excerpt: "The horizon speaks softly of what is yet to come...",
    text: `The horizon speaks softly of what is yet to come,
a promise stitched in gold across the sky.
Though today’s storms leave me numb,
tomorrow’s whispers teach me why.

Dreams are seeds in midnight ground,
rooted where no eye can see.
Yet with patience they will be found,
blooming into destiny.`

  {
    id: "p3",
    title: "Chains of Poverty",
    price: 9.00,
    excerpt: "I walk in shoes with soles worn thin...",
    text: `I walk in shoes with soles worn thin,
the streets remember every scar.
Poverty grips tight like sin,
yet still I chase a distant star.

Empty pockets, but a heart still wide,
a feast of love I cannot sell.
Though the world may laugh and chide,
my spirit rises — I will not dwell.`
  },
  {
    id: "p4",
    title: "Nine Voices",
    price: 8.50,
    excerpt: "The chorus of nine fills my home...",
    text: `The chorus of nine fills my home,
each voice a different song.
They argue, they play, they roam,
yet together they all belong.

I am conductor of chaos and grace,
a keeper of endless fire.
Though exhaustion marks my face,
their music lifts me higher.`
  },
  {
    id: "p5",
    title: "Silent Strength",
    price: 6.00,
    excerpt: "Not every warrior wears armor or wields a blade...",
    text: `Not every warrior wears armor or wields a blade,
some stand in kitchens, weary but unafraid.
They fight with love, with patience, with care,
battles unseen, yet always there.

Strength is silent, it rarely shouts,
it bends but never breaks.
It’s the power that wipes away doubts,
and gives more than it takes.`

  {
    id: "p6",
    title: "Letter to My Children",
    price: 10.00,
    excerpt: "If you read these words when I am gone...",
    text: `If you read these words when I am gone,
know that I gave you all I had.
My nights were short, my mornings long,
yet your laughter made me glad.

Carry my lessons in your stride,
let kindness be your guide.
Even when the world seems wrong,
remember, love will keep you strong.`

  {
    id: "p7",
    title: "The Road of Sacrifice",
    price: 11.00,
    excerpt: "Every choice I make is a step away from myself...",
    text: `Every choice I make is a step away from myself,
but a step closer to keeping you fed.
I stack dreams on the highest shelf,
so you can dream instead.

Sacrifice is a road paved with tears,
yet I walk it without regret.
For the joy of your future years,
is the treasure I will never forget.`
  },
  {
    id: "p8",
    title: "Unseen Battles",
    price: 4.50,
    excerpt: "You will never know the wars I fight in silence...",
    text: `You will never know the wars I fight in silence,
the storms that rage behind my smile.
For your sake I bury the violence,
and walk with grace another mile.

A father’s heart must carry both,
the pain and the hope intertwined.
For love is a sacred oath,
etched eternal in my mind.`
  },
  {
    id: "p9",
    title: "The Poet’s Curse",
    price: 12.00,
    excerpt: "To bleed in ink is to live twice — once in pain, once in memory...",
    text: `To bleed in ink is to live twice,
once in pain, once in memory.
Each line a wound, each verse a slice,
a quiet form of alchemy.

Yet cursed though I may be,
I write because I must.
For poetry sets my spirit free,
and turns my dust to trust.`
