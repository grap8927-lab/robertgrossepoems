    "text": "In the quiet womb, a whisper begins,\nA heartbeat dances, where life softly spins.\nThrough shadows and light, the journey unfolds,\nA tapestry woven with stories untold.\nFirst breath of air, a cry breaks the night,\nEyes wide with wonder, the world comes to light.\nTiny fingers grasp, a mother’s warm hand,\nIn the cradle of love, we learn to stand.\nDays roll like tides, with laughter and tears,\nChildhood's sweet magic, untainted by fears.\nWe stumble and run, in fields lush and green,\nChasing the sun, in a world so serene.\nBut storms will arise, as they often do,\nThe heart learns to break, and the spirit feels blue.\nFriendships may falter, and dreams may take flight,\nYet hope is a candle, that burns through the night.\nAdolescence arrives, a tempest of change,\nWith questions of self, as we learn to rearrange.\nThe mirror reflects both the beauty and strife,\nWe wrestle with shadows, the search for our life.\nThen comes the dawn of a new, hopeful age,\nWith passions ignited, we step on the stage.\nCareers that we chase, love’s tender embrace,\nWe build and we break, in this intricate race.\nYet time is a thief, it slips through our hands,\nMoments like grains of sand on distant strands.\nWe witness the seasons, the laughter, the pain,\nIn joy and in sorrow, we dance in the rain.\nAs years turn to gold, and the twilight draws near,\nWe cherish the whispers of those we hold dear.\nReflections of youth, in the lines on our face,\nA life full of colors, a beautiful trace.\nIn the final breaths, as the curtain descends,\nWe gather our stories, our lovers, our friends.\nWith gratitude whispered, we cherish the ride,\nFor in every struggle, our spirits have thrived.\nSo here is the tale, from birth to the end,\nA tapestry woven, where all hearts can mend.\nThrough trials and triumphs, we find our own way,\nIn the dance of existence, we live for today.",
